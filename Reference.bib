	abstract = {While the existing literature has identiﬁed a sizable incumbency advantage in single-member district (SMD) races in developed democracies, we argue that some political and institutional contexts of Japan's Lower House elections would undermine the incumbency advantage. Our regression discontinuity (RD) analysis indeed shows little advantage, and further examination suggests this as largely due to the “bestloser” provision in Japan's mixed-member system, which gives a loser of SMD competition a chance to be a “resurrected” incumbent. We also show no evidence of sorting e i.e., systematic difference between bare winners and bare losers e in close SMD races and thus add further evidence to support the methodological argument that the election RD analysis is a viable and promising research design.},

We argue that strategically acting party gatekeepers who update their nomination strategies based on voter behavior contribute to this representation gap. Drawing on unique panel data from Swiss local elections, we find that candidates with a “foreignsounding” name systematically receive not only fewer votes but are also fielded on less promising list positions compared to native candidates. We track candidates across elections and show that this inequality is driven by voter discrimination in previous elections. Our study carries relevance for research on minority candidates by linking different stages in the electoral process and showing how parties indirectly discriminate due to their use of candidate-performance information. It also bears practical implications, pointing to avenues how parties can break the cycle of discrimination in the electoral process.},

While this may be a mere projection of their lack among voters and party members, the article investigates whether being young is a disadvantage in election processes, and if age effects differ by gender. Bridging the literature on gender \& politics and political behavior, the article draws on an innovative sequential mixed-method design. Studying the 2019 Irish local elections, it uses 33 interviews to build hypotheses, which are subsequently tested on an original candidate-level dataset (n = 1884). The ﬁndings suggest that, when controlling for party afﬁliation and political status, being young can provide a net electoral advantage to male candidates. In contrast, young female candidates appear to be advantaged by their age but penalized by their gender. The article thus contributes to our understanding about the conditions right at the start of political careers and the emergence of intersectional representational inequalities.},

This article documents mice 2.9, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

Yet scholarship still grapples with a major leak in the pipeline to power: that many qualified and politically ambitious women decide against candidacy. Focusing on women with political ambition, we theorize that at the final stage of candidate emergence, household income, breadwinning responsibilities, and household composition are interlocking obstacles to women’s candidacies. We examine these dynamics through a multimethod design that includes an original survey of women most likely to run for office: alumnae of the largest Democratic campaign training organization in the United States. Although we do not find income effects, we provide evidence that breadwinning—responsibility for a majority of household income—
              negatively
              affects women’s ambition, especially for mothers. These findings have important implications for understanding how the political economy of the household affects candidate emergence and descriptive representation in the United States.},

We find small differences in the ratings of candidates in response to sex, religion, age and education cues but more sizeable effects are apparent for the candidate's occupation and place of residence. Even once we introduce a control for political party into our experimental scenarios the effect of candidate's place of residence continues to have a sizeable impact on candidate evaluations. Our research suggests that students of electoral behaviour should pay attention to a wider range of candidate cues.},

When the endogeneity of candidate spending levels is properly taken into account, the marginal effects of incumbent and challenger spending are roughly equal. In contrast to previous research showing that, because of higher marginal returns to challenger spending, the incumbent's spending advantage cannot explain high incumbent reelection rates, this article shows that in an average Senate election the incumbent's spending advantage yields a 6\% increase in the incumbent's vote share. That incumbent spending wins elections has direct implications regarding the consequences of campaign finance reform. My findings imply that equalizing spending levels may significantly increase incumbent defeat rates, and caps on candidate spending may improve the chances of challengers.},

	abstract = {Proportional representation (PR) electoral systems are commonly considered more advantageous for the election of women compared to majoritarian electoral systems. In mixed electoral systems, female candidates are often more likely to be elected through the PR tier compared to women running in single-member district races. While most mixed systems employ a closed-list, a number of legislatures use a best loser provision whereby losing district candidates are ordered on the PR list based on their performance in single-member districts. This paper examines the extent to which best loser laws impact the election of women using candidate data from sub-national legislatures in Mexico and Germany and Japan's House of Representatives. We ﬁnd the contamination of PR lists by single-member district results reduces the advantage women candidates have in the PR tier. Best loser limits the ability of political parties to use PR to represent groups underrepresented in singlemember district elections.},

Results show that frequency of elections, opportunity for double listings, electoral volatility and legislative institutionalization have statistically significant effects on turnover. In addition the type of electoral system (majoritarian versus proportional representation) is shown to have a statistically and substantively significant effect, with turnover much greater in the latter. Possible explanations for this effect are explored.},

To understand the mechanisms behind the underrepresentation of young people in public oﬃce, we conducted two novel survey experiments in Japan. We asked voters in these experiments to evaluate the photos of hypothetical candidates while altering candidates’ faces using age regression and progression software to make them appear as if they are younger or older. Contrary to the observed age demographics of politicians, the voters in our experiments strongly disliked older candidates but viewed younger and middle-aged candidates as equally favorable. Voters saw young candidates as less experienced but also more likely to focus on many policy issues over a longer period, including education, childcare, climate change, anti-corruption measures, and multiculturalism. Young voters especially liked young candidates, suggesting that greater youth turnout could increase youth representation. Conversely, elderly candidates were universally panned, seen as the least competent, least likely to focus on most policy issues, and least electable. Voter biases thus do not seem to be a driving factor behind the shortage of young politicians. To the contrary, voters appear perfectly willing to cast their ballots for young candidates.},

Their central concern is how and why some politicians succeed in moving into the highest offices of state, while others fail. The book examines the relative dearth of women, black and working-class Members of Parliament, and whether the evident social bias in the British political élite matters for political representation. Legislative recruitment concerns the critical step from lower levels (activists, local counsellors) to a parliamentary career. The authors draw evidence from the first systematic surveys of parliamentary candidates, Members of Parliament and party selectors, as well as detailed personal interviews. The study explores how and why people become politicians, and the consequences for parties, legislatures and representative government.},

When the vast majority of incumbents are men, as is the case in most national legislatures, incumbency emerges as a male advantage that could hinder the election of women. However, there has been no multi-countrydcross-institutional, cross-socioeconomicd study of the relationship between incumbency and women’s descriptive representation. Using time-serial data on 33 national legislatures, I examine whether incumbency is a disadvantage for women’s election. I ﬁnd that higher retention rates lead to fewer women winning oﬃce after controlling for socioeconomic factors, gender quotas, and electoral rules. Further, term limits, although not designed to promote the election of women, have a positive side eﬀect for women’s representation.},

	abstract = {Middle-aged to senior men of the ethnic majority and higher income groups are generally overrepresented in parliaments. While research on group representation has examined issues of gender, economic standing, and, more recently, ethnicity, few studies examine age groups. We argue that the design of political institutions influences the share of young adults in parliaments across nations and hypothesize that the electoral system type, age candidacy requirements, and quotas influence the share of younger deputies in national parliaments. Analyzing an original data set with a global cross-national sample, we find that proportional representation and giving candidates the right to stand in elections as early as possible (i.e. at the age of 18) matter. In contrast, quota provisions for youths are currently too selectively applied to increase the percentage of young deputies in parliament.},

We examine the gendered pipeline to power across three potential candidate pools: lower-level officeholders, those named in newspapers as likely candidates, and lawyers who made political contributions. We find some evidence that women are less likely to seek elected office; however, the dearth of women in the pipeline plays a much greater role in the lack of women candidates. For the gender disparity in candidates to close, women have to be far more likely to run for office than men, particularly on the Republican side. Our results highlight the need to consider the gendered pipeline to power alongside rates of entry in studies of women’s underrepresentation.},

After this, Japanese parties, candidates, and voters were faced with a completely new set of rules for Lower House elections, and the purpose of this chapter is to assess the e ects of this electoral system revision. First describes the old electoral system, in which the members of the Lower House were elected by single, non‐transferable vote (SNTV) from multi‐member districts, and the new one, which is a mixed‐member majoritarian (MMM) system; key changes are pointed out. The following two sections describe the political changes that seem to have followed from the electoral reform, discussing rst the interparty dimension (party‐system consequences) and second, the intraparty dimension (party organization and personalistic politics), with speci c reference to whether or not the MMM system has solved the problems of the SNTV system (intraparty competition and its personalistic consequences) and thereby increased the e ciency of the electoral system.

	abstract = {This paper examines a factor affecting why the interests of the older electorate often prevail in politics in developed countries with aging populations, namely the difference in issue salience related to governmental programs for the elderly. Analysis of data collected with a national electoral survey in Japan conducted at every national election between 1972 and 2016 (28 surveys) revealed that elderly voters have been far more attentive—and more consistently attentive—to the welfare issue than the younger electorate when making voting choices. Moreover, the gap has grown in recent years as the population ages and the welfare program matures, probably due to policy feedback. This gap would enhance the influence of the elderly over the issue beyond their numbers and higher turnout, as discussed in previous studies. This result explains why welfare reform for the elderly has been very difficult, at least in Japan, despite (or, indeed, because of) considerable intergenerational inequality under the current system. At the same time, this result also shows that issue salience is not static but responds to media coverage, especially among young voters who would, otherwise, show less interest in the issue. In other words, lively public debate of the issue, covered by news media, can decrease the salience gap between the youth and the elderly.},

Yet, research is rarely able to address the issue of age group representation systematically because we are lacking empirical information on the age distribution in parliaments. The Worldwide Age Representation in Parliaments (WARP) data set remedies this dearth of data. It provides information about the numerical presence of age groups in parliaments, spanning across the globe and over time and includes age data on legislators, such as the share of members of parliament (MPs) aged 30 years or under, 35 years or under, or 40 years or under. The data set also reports measures that compare the presence of legislators aged 30 years or under, aged 35 years or under, aged 40 years or under, aged 41 to 60 years, as well as aged 61 years or over in relation to the same age group in the general population of a given country. Moreover, it includes gendered ﬁgures, such as the presence of young female MPs. The WARP data set contains data for more than 700 elections in 149 countries, so far, and is freely available online. It allows for a novel analysis of the age composition of legislatures.},

This has consequences: it risks favouring policies geared towards the interests of older cohorts, it might alienate youth from voting and could push parties to appeal (even more) to older voters. In this review, we synthesize the growing literature on youth representation. We do so by: (1) delineating the group of young politicians, (2) discussing why youth ought to be present in politics, (3) empirically depicting the state of youth representation, and (4) illustrating the factors that help or harm youth to enter politics. This synthesis shows the degree to which young people are absent from decision-making bodies across the national, subnational and supra-national levels and attempts to make sense of the reasons why there is such a dearth of youth as candidates and representatives.

We track candidates across elections and show that this inequality is driven by voter discrimination in previous elections. Our study carries relevance for research on minority candidates by linking different stages in the electoral process and showing how parties indirectly discriminate due to their use of candidate-performance information. It also bears practical implications, pointing to avenues how parties can break the cycle of discrimination in the electoral process.},

It has been adopted by emerging and established democracies without adequate understanding of its potential impact on the party system. Using the Japanese and Russian cases, our analysis demonstrates that mixed-superposition systems generate incentives and outcomes that differ from PR and SMD systems and encourage the development of a multiparty system. We test the degree to which the mechanical effect punishes small parties in mixed-superposition, PR and SMD systems and ﬁnd that the mechanical effect is less punishing in mixed-superposition systems than in SMD systems. We also test whether or not there is contamination across the components of the mixed-superposition system with regression analyses of district-level voting data. Our results support the notion that mixed systems are not simple combinations of their component parts and that scholars must control for contamination when they study mixed systems. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Using district level election results, we examine the eﬀects of the proportional representation (PR) and single-member district (SMD) tiers of mixed systems separately and in combination. We also test the eﬀects on electoral outcomes of diﬀerent components of mixed systems such as linked tiers, ratio of SMD to PR seats, and majority versus plurality rules in the SMD tier. Our ﬁndings suggest that, despite claims of a ‘‘contamination eﬀect’’ between the two tiers, in countries with developed party systems, PR and SMD electoral arrangements tend to approximate their expected eﬀects even when used in combination in mixed systems. We also ﬁnd that particular institutional characteristics within mixed systems have a substantial constraining eﬀect on the number of signiﬁcant political parties. However, the nature of the party system itself, in particular the extent to which its parties are institutionalized, also plays a very important role in shaping the degree to which constraining eﬀects are truly felt.},

Using data from the World Bank’s Database of Political Institutions, we address this gap in the literature by investigating two related questions. First, do mixed electoral rules produce diﬀerent election outcomes than other election rules? Second, are these results attenuated by the deﬁnitions of mixed systems that scholars employ? We ﬁnd that mixed systems generate outcomes that are distinct from other electoral systems and that these ﬁndings are generally robust across diﬀerent deﬁnitions.},

We examine whether candidates in the proportional representation (PR) tier of these systems take policy stances closer to their party’s position while candidates in the single member district (SMD) tier adopt policy positions to appeal to their districts preferences. We exploit a comprehensive panel survey of all candidates for the Japanese Upper and Lower House elections between 2003 and 2010 and estimate the policy positions of each candidate over time using Bayesian item response theory model. Our analysis suggests that candidates’ policy positions vary substantially within parties. In addition, the two major parties appear to converge in the economic policy dimension during this period. In general, we ﬁnd limited evidence consistent with the “best of both worlds” hypothesis. In the economic policy dimension, there is tentative evidence that Lower House SMD candidates are responding to their districts’ preferences while PR candidates are closer to the position of the median party member. In the main foreign/security policy dimension, however, SMD candidates are not particularly responsive to their districts’ preferences.},

Pre‐electoral coordination in the majoritarian component of mixed electoral systems, however, is far from uncommon. In this article, we identify a number of institutional incentives that induce political parties to form pre‐electoral alliances in spite of contamination effects. By identifying institutions that favor and hamper coordination, we seek to advance the understanding of PR‐SMD interactions and to assess their implications for the design, classification, and empirical analysis of mixed electoral rules.

Moreover, it jointly evaluates how incumbency and gender affect nomination. This study uses European Parliament elections to compare a plethora of parties, operating under numerous institutions, in the context of a single legislature. It finds that gender differences in candidate selection are largely explained by incumbency bias, although party ideology and female labor force participation help explain which parties prioritize the placement of novice women.},
